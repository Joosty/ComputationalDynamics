    "You may recall that dynamics was principally divided into two key parts: __kinematics__ and __kinetics__. If you've followed along this far, here's a recap of our journey:\n",
    "  1. We have already examined kinematics in some detail. One must pause to take note here that, in this case, motion was investigated without considering the forces causing it.\n",
    "  2. Then, we introduced concepts such as mass/inertia scalars.\n",
    "  3. Next we focused on forces; moments; and the various types of momenta.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This leads up to the final act: __kinetics__, which is the piece of the puzzle that relates the causes of motion (forces and moments) to the bodies. The law that connects them is one that you are likely already familiar with - Newton's Second Law. Quite simply put, this law states that the acceleration of a particle $P$ (for now, denoted as $\\mathbf{a}$) is directly proportional to the force $\\mathbf{F}$ acting on it. One may have also seen this law written as the following equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Definition 1**: Textbooks often define something known as a primary inertial system, which is a reference frame that is neither translating nor rotating in space. The laws of Newton are said to hold in this frame; experiments show that the laws are valid in such a frame as long as the velocities involved are negligible compared with the speed of light, which is 300,000 km/s. Consequently, for several engineering problems, the Earth can be approximated to an inertial frame in studying the motion of objects moving on it (like cars) and close to it (spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition 2**: It is also seen that Newton’s laws hold in any non-rotating reference frame that moves with a constant velocity; the time derivative of a constant velocity leads to zero acceleration. Thus, another definition emerges for an inertial frame as a frame which has zero acceleration (or is a non-accelerating reference frame).\n",
