# ## Particle Kinematics: Position, Velocity, Acceleration

# So far, we have analyzed changes in orientations of reference frames and the resulting parameters
# of angular velocity and angular acceleration. In other words, these parameters measure the
# changes in angles (or angular positions). Now, we will study changes in positions of points. This
# topic is also called **translational kinematics**. A pictorial representation of the problem is shown
# and then described below.

# 
# $O$ is a point rigidly attached to the reference frame $A$.
# 
# $P$ is a particle of mass $m$ and is moving along the dashed path. It is said to be translating relative to frame $A$.
# 
# **Position of P in A**:
# 
# We utilize $\vec{r}$ a position vector to locate $P$-the vector has its tail fixed in $A$ and its tip (or head) tracks $P$.
# 
# **Velocity of P in A**:
# 
# Notation:
# 
# $$
# {}^{A}\vec{v}^{P}
# $$
# 
# Mathematically, this velocity of P in A is defined as:

# 
# **Acceleration of P in A**:
# 
# Notation:
# 
# $$
# {}^{A}\vec{a}^{P}
# $$
# 
# Mathematically, this acceleration of $P$ in $A$ is defined as:

# 
# $N$ is a fixed reference frame to which link $A$ is attached at a point $O$. $B$ is a second link attached to $A$ at point $Q$. This system is commonly called a double pendulum. We assume that both links are of the same length $l$.
# 
# $P$ is a particle that is sliding on $B$, the second link of the double pendulum. It is located from point $Q$ by a scalar time-varying parameter $x$. 
# 
# The two angles that describe the double pendulumâ€™s two links are also shown in the figure, namely: $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. You are to compute:
