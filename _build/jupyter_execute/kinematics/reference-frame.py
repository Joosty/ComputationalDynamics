# * The figure above shows a reference frame $A$ and vector $\vec{v}$.
# * $\vec{v}$ is said to be fixed in the frame $A$ if and only if none of the characteristics of $\vec{v}$ are seen to change when it is observed from $A$.

# Notice that I have introduced the unit vectors $\hat{b}_x$ and $\hat{b}_y$ for the reference frame $B$ but $\hat{b}_z$ is not shown though it is orthogonal to both $\hat{b}_x$ and $\hat{b}_y$.
# 
# For sake of developing subsequent discussions, we will now also introduce a dextral set of unit vectors for frame
