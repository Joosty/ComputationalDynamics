# ## Fundamental concepts

# The following definitions are used in kinematics:
# 
# 1. **Particles**: Objects that can be modelled as point masses, having negligible dimension.
# 2. **Poin**t: A massless particle.
# 3. **Rigid bodies**: Objects that have some shape. They can have a mass or be massless. Also, these objects do not deform when a force is applied to them.
# 4. **Reference frame**: A massless rigid body with respect to which an analyst observes and measures motion of objects.
