# ## Rigid Body Kinematics

# Kinematics or Rigid body kinematics is the study of motion while ignoring the cause of motion.
# 
# In kinematics, we are interested in "position", "velocity", and â€œacceleration" and the relationship between them.
# 
# In other words, using the figure below, we are interested in describing the motion of $B$ in $A$.
