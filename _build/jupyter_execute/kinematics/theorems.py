# ## Two key velocity/acceleration transfer theorems

# There are two theorems that are useful in particle kinematics that allow us to compute velocities and accelerations by transferring them to another point. They are discussed below.
# 
# ### Theorem 1: Two-point theorem
# 
# This theorem is useful for determining the velocity (and/or acceleration) of one point on a rigid body by using (or transferring to) another point on the same rigid body.
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/74.png

# name: 74
# ---
# ```
# 
# In the above figure, $P$ and $Q$ are two points that are rigidly fixed to the same rigid body, $B$. Further, $B$ is in freemotion relative to $A$. In other words, $B$ is moving freely in $A$; in other words, it is rotating and translating when viewed from $A$.
# 
# In such a scenario, the following two relationships can be used to compute the velocity and acceleration of $P$ in $A$.

# 
# #### Some special cases of theorem 1
# 
# ##### Case 1
# 
# If B is purely in translation:
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/77.png
# ---
# name: 77
# ---
# ```
# 
# ##### Case 2
# 
# If B is in simple rotation about a fixed axis. E.g., a simple pendulum, (see figure).
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/78.png

# name: 78

# ```
# 
# ##### Case 3
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/79.png
# ---
# name: 79
# ---
# ```
# 
# Consider the case shown in the above figure containing two discs, $A$ and $B$. The two discs are rolling on each other and maintain a single point of contact $P$. Their motion is observed from a fixed frame $N$.
# 
# As the point $P$ is clearly shared between the 2 bodies, we introduce the following notation:
# 
# * $P_A$ is the contact point belonging to body $A$.
# * $P_B$ is the contact point belonging to body $B$.
# 
# If it is said that A rolls without slip on B, then the following assumption can be made in
# tackling a problem:
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/80.png

# ```
# 
# ###### Common example for rolling without slip
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/81.png

# name: 81

# ```
# 
# In the figure above, the disk $D$ rolls without slip on $A$. $P$ is a point on the disk’s circumference.

# 
# ### Theorem 2: One-point theorem
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/83.png
# ---
# name: 83
# ---
# ```
# 
# In the above figure, $P$ is a point that translates relative to body, $B$. Point $Q$ is rigidly attached to $B$. The one-point theorem allows computation of the velocity and acceleration of $P$ relative to the frame $A$, while accounting for the relative motion of $P$ as seen from $B$. The velocity formula is given by Equation $7.5$.
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/84.png
# ---
# name: 84
# ---
# ```
# 
# ${}^{B}\vec{v}^{P}$ is the velocity of $P$ in $B$. This term is also called _relative velocity_.
# 
# The highlighted term is referred to as coincident point velocity. This highlighted set of terms are identical in form to that seen in the two-point theorem.
# 
# The acceleration in this scenario is computed from Equation $7.6$ (also called five-term beast):
# 
# ```{figure} ./images/85.png

# name: 85
# ---
# ```
# 
# The terms in the acceleration equation have special terminology; these are shown below. Also, note that the ‘transport acceleration’ term below is identical in form to the two-point theorem acceleration formula.

# ### Student Activities

# ```
# 
# 1. Derive relationships $7.3$ and $7.4$. You need to make use of key result $2$ (derivative theorem) and the definitions of velocities and accelerations.
# 2. Derive the relationships given by and using the figure below. You will need to draw TWO more position vectors for the derivation. In the figure, $O$ is rigidly attached To $A$; $Q$ is rigidly attached to $B$; $P$ moves along a path on $B$; and $B$ moves freely relative to $A$.
# 3. Prove that if $P$ were rigidly fixed to $B$, then the onepoint theorem relations result in the the two-point theorem relationships.
# 4. Find: ${}^{N}\vec{v}^{P}$ and ${}^{A}\vec{v}^{P}$ for the particle sliding on the double pendulum using the relevant velocity transfer theorems, as appropriate.
