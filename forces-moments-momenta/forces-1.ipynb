    "## Bound vector\n",
    "A **bound vector** is a vector that acts along a specific line in space and is associated with a particular point. This means it is \"bound\" to its line of action and affects that specific point. For example, in the figure below, the force $\\mathbf {F}$ acts on the body $B$ at a specific point $P$, which lies on the line of action of $\\mathbf{F}$. Thus, $\\mathbf {F}$ is a bound vector.\n",

    "__Free (or unbound) vector__ is a vector that is not bound to a line of action. A good example of this is the angular velocity vector that acts on a body. The angular velocity of a body has a magnitude and direction but does not act at a specific point; this is because the angular velocity is the same at any location on a single rigid body. This is illustrated in the figure below.\n",

    "## Moments\n",
    "\n",
    "If a vector is classified as a bounded one, then one can define a parameter called the moment for this bound vector about a specific point. For an example of this reflect take the figure below. This figure illitrates a force $\\mathbf{F}$ being exterted on point, $P$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf {M}^{\\mathbf{F}/O} \\triangleq \\mathbf{r}^{OP} \\times \\mathbf{F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{r}^{OP}$ is the position vector from $O$ to $P$.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{M}^{\\mathbf{F}/O}$ is the moment of $\\mathbf{F}$ about $O$.\n",

    "Given a set of vectors and a reference point $P$ discussed earlier, we can find the moment of this set about another point $Q$ (see figure below). This can be done using a theorem that involves the resultant vector $R$ of the set, which is explained below the figure.\n",

    "A set of bound vectors with zero resultant is said to be a couple. A couple is not a vector; it is a set of vectors.

    "## Equivalence\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalence is another important concept in dynamics that applies to sets of vectors. Two sets of vectors, $\\mathbf{S}_1$ and $\\mathbf{S}_2$, are said to be equivalent if and only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The resultant of $\\mathbf{S}_1$ is identical to the resultant of $\\mathbf{S}_2$.\n",
    "-  The moment of $\\mathbf{S}_1$ about some point $O$ is identical to the moemnt of $\\mathbf{S}_2$ about the same point $O$.\n",

    "```{note}\n",
    "If the sets have the same moments about $O$, they will have the same moments about any other point, as well.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Replacement\n",
    "If we have two sets of bound vectors that are equivalent, then in the context of rigid body dynamics one of the sets can always be __replaced__ by the other __equivalent__ set. In other words, either set of vectors can be called a __replacement__ of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two couples have equal torques, then they are replacement of each other because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The resultant, $\\mathbf{S}$, of the couples are zero; and\n",
    "- They have the same moment (or torque) about any point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pictorial example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the body $B$ with a point $P$ with only a set of forces $<\\mathbf{F}_{1}, \\mathbf{F}_{2}, \\mathbf{F}_{3}, \\mathbf{F}_{4}>$ acting on it as shown below:\n",

    "name: 10\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These forces can be replaced by another equivalent set; this set consists of:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf F$, a single force through $P$, which has the same resultant as the above set of forces.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf T$, a torque of a couple with the same moment about $P$, as the set of forces $<\\mathbf{F}_{1}, \\mathbf{F}_{2}, \\mathbf{F}_{3}, \\mathbf{F}_{4}>$.\n",

    "So, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_i \\mathbf{F}_i = \\mathbf{F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_i \\mathbf{M}^{\\mathbf{F}/P} = \\mathbf T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we have described everything above in the context of forces and moments of force, the developments apply to vectors more generally. In other words, one set of bound vectors can be replaced by another set; this second set consists of one bound vector (i.e., the resultant of the first set) and a torque of a couple."
